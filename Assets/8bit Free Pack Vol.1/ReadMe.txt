     //8BIT FREE PACK VOL.1//

Guidelines:

	You can import these mp3 audio files in the same way as other assets, simply by dragging the files into the Project panel. 

	Importing an audio file creates an Audio Clip which can then be dragged to an Audio Source or used from a script. 

	The Audio Clip reference page has more details about the import options available for audio files. https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AudioFiles.html


In case you want more tracks you can send over a mail to paundra.producer@gmail.com for custom requests.
